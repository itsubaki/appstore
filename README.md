2: Netflix(363590051) [Netflix, Inc.]
[1][Error] I'm receiving error message 10013 for the past day or so I don't know how to fix it / Lagorejess
[1][App Won't Load] App keeps saying there's no Internet connection, all my other apps are working just fine. Shows won't load. / okbaby_
[5][Good app] App is pretty stable overall. One improvement could be to allow to jump forward 10 seconds button / Illinois Customer
[1][Netflix why!?] Ok so I'm trying to watch "Jack and the coco-clock heart" but all I get is one picture and I think that right now Netflix is a piece of crap... plz fix / Katie grand
[4][App crashing] App crashing! Screen turns black, sometimes can't even get it open! Start to get upset üòÇüòÇüòÇ. For real thou. Fix it please. / Ahliezah
[1][I'm disappointed üòî] I really want to give this a 5 star because the actual movies and TV shows are really good. But I just can't with these problems. Sometimes I don't even want the app but it just opens by itself. But when I actually want it, the app will crash or won't let me play movies. Please change these mistakes ASAP so I can give this a 5 star rating üò°üò° / Megawesome‚úåüèºÔ∏è
[1][Can't Even Install App] For some reason, the app was grayed out on my screen -- maybe because I needed to update the app. But now I can't even install the app. It gets stuck after downloading. / Asking Q
[1][Errors] An error pops up every time i press on a title, it's a different error sometimes but usually it's the same one. I've tried in different cities and restarting the app and deleting and getting it back and trying different internets but now, Netflix is having problems and it is making my whole day frustrating. / Xxxem4xxX
[1][App is keep crashing.... now I can't even use the app anymore.] What happened guys. this is terrible. how do you suggest I use this app... I am seeing same as the last review. I wish there was less than one star. / Voldomre
[1][Problem with the version] When I am watching, no matter what, the app crashes!! / Starflowers1
[1][Terrible] The app refuses to work on Cellular.  It keeps saying "No Internet Connection" despite it being connected to Cellular and the phone not being on Airplane Mode. / Chris Ban
[4][Netflix "The Best App"] This app is great! Now you can download movies and shows. Perfect for traveling / Caire10
[1][App crashing and not saving my place!!] The Netflix app has suddenly stopped keeping my place in a show or movie and just starts over at the beginning of that episode/movie when I open the app. This happens between 5-10 times per day. The app also crashes and sends me to the home screen of my phone a couple of seconds into watching something. This has started happening twice a day. Maybe I watch too much Netflix, but these people need to get it right. / Mike Binette
[1][Netflix I'm pretty disappointed.] It's a decent app and it does have a reasonable amount of shows and movies and such. But it could really use an update in many categories a lot of the content is a little dated and the Anime section. It's very shameful and some very popular anime's have recently been removed such as : FairyTail, Black Butler and more so if you could please take it upon yourselves to upgrade the content in all the categories that would be simply lovely. / Netflix is a disgrace
[2][Screw up] The removal of the 5 star rating system, and removal of old shows and replacing them with terrible Netflix originals makes me want to unsubscribe faster than the drop in quality of my recommended list. / Dudiwhfiekwhdhfh
[2][Nothing for 8-10 year olds in Marvel] One recommendation if you are a adult you know this already; all the Marvel shows (Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones) are TV-MA and the only PG or PG-13 movies are Captain America Civil War and LEGO marvel. Sadly that's why I give 2 stars. / xinfinity 2.0
[1][Shows with missing episode not even a complete series] This is really disappointing I was watching one of my shows and all of the episodes weren't there and all the rest of them didn't even have the second season I just ask to add the rest of the episodes to blue exorcist attack on titan and fairy tail / butch8313
[5][Good app] :) / YL Drop Stars
[3][Please fix this] I love Netflix but for the last few days, I open the app it works fine until I try to watch a show then it says error (10030) stuff like that so i can't watch anything / Brownie231491
[3][Usually give 5 stars but...] Ever since the last update it hasn't been loading. And when it does it says error. Won't let me play anything. Keeps saying check internet connection. It's all connected. And I have unlimited data. So I don't understand why this is happening. Been going on for a few days now. This is a big downer for me since I love Netflix. Please fix.. / BabyCakes91
[1][Complete garbage] If you expect me to pay for another month the gd app better not fing crash every time I try to watch a video.  It is about effective as staring at my blank white wall. Actually, staring at my wall is much less frustrating. Also like/dislike options? What kind of weak ineffective rating system is that?  It is imprecise and ineffective and just seems like it was put in place to shield some special snowflakes from honest critique. A nonfunctional app is worth less than a rock. / Ogilthorp
[1][Terrible] Bring the old ratings system back so we can properly rate your own politicized garbage, thus saving time for many people. / xavior mcfredrickson
[1][The app keeps crashing] I normally don't have any trouble with the app, but since the last update, anything I try to watch (including things I've downloaded) will play for around 30 seconds and then the app crashes, and it happens every time, so I haven't been able to watch anything. If this gets fixed, I will re-rate the app because I normally love it. / Brainwords
[3][Can't use it] I personally love Netflix. However, the app doesn't work at all. I can't even get in to log in! This has been happening for a month or so now. / Miiiiiiiimo
[1][Incompatible with ChromeCast] If I want to stream to my ChromeCast, I have to uninstall, redownload, and reinstall the app, every single time, because it refuses to recognize that I have a ChromeCast if I simply open the app. It doesn't matter if I reset the ChromeCast, or my router and modem. If I want to stream to my ChromeCast, I have to uninstall and reinstall it every single time. What a pain.  Edited to add: since they updated the app on 5/1, it's worse. At this point I almost hope they don't fix it, since if it suddenly started working, I'd probably suffer a cardiac event from the shock. / Hipster Kale
[1][Upset] I can't watch üò≥it freezes on me & says I don't have internet although I do have / Wryloklnjjnnmm
[3][Not as good as Android version] On Android if you put your phone to sleep mode, then return to the Netflix app it will display the video progress immediately. Whereas, on iPhone the status/controls must be reloaded. Additionally, controls can be accessed on android lock screen, but not on iPhone. CMON!! / Joshua sky
[1][horrible!] i loved netflix, up until today when it kept saying my password / email was incorrect. it wasn't, considering someone i share the account with checked and it was fine for them. garbage! / Yoyouoyouoyoyohoyoyoyipadsrcuk
[2][Crashes] Latest version keeps crashing. Will try to load video on iPad, the loading wheel pops up and then crashes shortly after. / ak137007
[2][At a loss for words] I love this app. Watch all my favorite shows and movies. But here recently I cant watch anything at all. No idea what's going on, but I'd gladly change this entire review to positive statements if I can return to my shows please. üôÉ Otherwise I love what it has to offer. / Mathew Jonker
[1][Lots of crashing] So for a while now, the app will crash at random, normally shortly after I've opened the app and about to watch something. And it's annoyingly frequent; I'll reopen the app several times and it still happens. They really need to fix this cause I'm so close to deleting this and switching to something else. / CreativeArt
[1][Bring back 1-5 star rating] So disappointed at this! This is how I would judge and find what's good to watch I hate this new % crap! / Mj23584
[1][FIX IT ALREADY.] I live in Japan, and judging by the Japanese reviews as well, MANY of your customers are experiencing sudden crashes upon selecting a program. It's incredibly annoying and shouldn't take this long to deliver a solution to a problem that leaves the application virtually unusable. / aengdulie
[5][Fresh Content] I had cancelled Netflix after using it for 5 years a while ago. But now I am back because of the more newer and exclusive Marvel quality content being created here at Netflix. Video quality and Navigability of the app is also amazing and impressive compared to the other streaming options. / Syed M Mehdi
[3][Please] put bad girls club on here and I'll like the app! / lexi1264
[1][Update=crashing] So many error messages and crashes since the new update. / N√ºtopian
[1][Won't play] It didn't let me watch anything even if I have payed for it. It keeps saying error . I tried signing out also deleted the app and getting it back and Turing off my phone. Nothing is working. / üòïüòå
[1][Glitchy] This app is so crazy glitchy. IF, and that's a big if, I can get my video to even load without an error code, it never saves my spot. So I always have trouble getting it to load and then when I do, I have to look for the last spot I was at manually because it never remembers / eagsam
[3][Bug with subtitles] Please fix this bug. It's so annoying to have to turn on subtitles for every episode. Just once and have them stay on please! / Meganashlay
[4][One problem!!( MAKe 3RD SEASOn of KUROMUKURO PLEASE)!!] My question is why does Netflix make Netflix originals if they don't even finish the season or make a new episode. Instead it leaves a cliff hanger and never has a new season or episode so what's the point of creating a Netflix original if you don't finish it in the first place......for example kuromukuro (anime Netflix original) the last season has been in 2016 so last year and I check to so if there was a possibility of a 3rd season but people said maybe or maybe not so what's the point of really watching something that doesn't have a end or that will not continue...... But to be honest I just want a 3rd season to kuromukuro please!!!! I want there to be a ending a good one it's just my favorite anime in Netflix and I hope Netflix makes more anime,Netflix Originals like that one or similar with romance,comedy,action, and drama so like the anime kuromukuro I guess but ya just please!!!!!! Make a ending to it I'm begging you?! / adilene B
[1][Keeps closing] I'll be 5 mins into a Show and it shuts down!!!  Happend 5 times already in the last 20 mins üëéüèºüëéüèºüëéüèºüò° / Dizz12345
[1][Thumbs down to the new rating system] Personally, I used to rate every movie I watched from 1-5 since I watch wayyyy too many movies. But now with the rating system a thumbs up or down I can't: 1) tell if I watched the movie before; and 2) if I did watch it before, did I rate it a 1 bc it was crap or did I rate it a 5 because I really liked it and would want to watch again?? I love Netflix, but please put the rating system back. I need the over 1,000 ratings I did brought back pleaseeee üò©üò© / MovieBinger
[1][Browsing is now impossible] Removal of the star rating system makes choosing a new content to watch nearly impossible. I'm constantly having to choose titles and scan through them to see if they are any good before actually watching and more often than not what's being put forward as the top picks are absolutely horrid. If you're trying to drive traffic to Amazon then you're succeeding. / MSM Sem
[1][What happened to the old Netflix?] Netflix is losing more and more of its shows. It is now full of mostly "ok" shows. And with the new update it won't even let me watch anything most of the time. The glitches are bad and honestly Netflix just seems to be a dying app. Very sad / Codecar
[1][Can't rate anything!] Bring back ratings! I'm getting terrible suggestions immediately when they took away the rating system. / Nocomplaints
[2][It's kinda annoying] It says a I have connection issues and I have to close out of it constantly and try again and again. And I just literally signed up. Kinda bums me out. / Chantal east coast
[1][0 Stars] You knew taking away the star rating would give you bad reviews, right? By trying to save your content from criticism you've made the whole app a waste of time. If I previously rate a show/movie one star and after the update it gives me a 98%  match how am I supposed to compare this to other videos? Just plain dumb. / Izzy sandbank
[1][üëé] 1 - stop taking shows off 2 - why the hell can't we take screenshots? / Izzy_Gurl
[1][A failure] Nothing will play. Waste of space. / Hbuguggyug
[4][Terrible changes, still great] Very confused on the low ratings. The only complaints I have are the rating systems and the increase of the price. Other than that, still great show selections. / JackyH1104
stats: [5] 6%(3/50), [4] 8%(4/50), [3]12%(6/50), [2]10%(5/50), [1]64%(32/50)
